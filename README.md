# Deep Learning Image Classification for Lung Illness Diagnosis

This project is a coding challenge presented by Codecademy, exploring the use of Deep Learning in image classification. The goal is to build a model that helps diagnose illnesses affecting patients' lungs based on X-ray scans, specifically pneumonia, Covid-19, or no illness.

## Features

- Built a deep learning image classification model using Keras.  
- Utilized **Callbacks** for model optimization.  
- Incorporated **TensorBoard** for visualizing training progress.  
- Performed **Hyperparameter Tuning** to improve model accuracy.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- TensorFlow (Keras)  
- TensorBoard  
- Pandas & NumPy for data preprocessing  
- Matplotlib for visualization
